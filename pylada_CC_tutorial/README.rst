A Simple Guide to Using Pylada
##############################

Here is a quick guide to using Pylada on Compute Canada machines.

Installation
============

To install Pylada on Niagara (or any cc computer) do this

.. code-block::

   module load python cmake intel/2020u4
   pip install --user --upgrade pip
   pip install --user git+https://github.com/pylada/pylada-light@few_fixes

I like to have it in a separate virtual environment:

.. code-block::

   module load python cmake intel/2020u4
   python -m venv pylada_env
   source pylada_env/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install git+https://github.com/pylada/pylada-light@few_fixes

This should take a little while, because it needs to compile from source. Make sure that python is 3.9 or less. After that you need to copy the file ``.pylada`` in your home directory (this file may be hidden, but it is in this folder!). At line 20 of that file change my username for yours

.. code-block:: python

   jobs   = Popen(['squeue', '-u', 'your_user_name'], stdout=PIPE, encoding='utf-8').communicate()[0].split('\n')

Lines 40-61 contain the slurm script that Pylada will use to launch jobs. Make sure to change L55-58 to the correct modules and environment that you are using if you are on a different computer.

.. code-block:: bash

   {header}
   python {scriptcommand}
   {footer}
   '''
    
.. note::

   On some Compute Canada computers there are no partitions, you will need to remove line 35. You may also have to manually source ~/.bashrc
    

Usage
=====

Pylada can be used for a lot of different things such as manipulating crystal structures and finding primitive cells. Here I will show you how to use it to submit VASP jobs. 

Submission script
-----------------

Let's go through ``HT_relax_example.ipy``.

Setting VASP files
******************

At lines 26-30 you can set the location of the VASP executable and the pseudo-potentials:

.. code-block:: python

    # Program and file location                                                                                                                                   
    vasp.program = '/scinet/niagara/software/commercial/vasp-6.1.2/bin/vasp_std'
    vasp.has_nlep = False

    pseudoDir = '/scinet/niagara/software/commercial/vasp-6.1.2/potpaw_PBE/'

Setting pseudopotentials
************************

The next few lines (32-45) set the pseudopotentials that you want to use for each element. This is useful if you want to use ultrasoft PPs or if you want to use a version with d or f orbitals. 

.. code-block:: python

    vasp.add_specie = "O", pseudoDir + "/O" # To use the O PP
    vasp.add_specie = "O", pseudoDir + "/O_s" # To use the O ultrasoft PP

Setting INCAR parameters
************************

Lines 46-77 set the INCAR parameters. A few things to note:

.. code-block:: python

    vasp.convergence = 1.0e-3

If you are relaxing cell parameters (which is not the case in this file, see below), it is good to do multiple relaxations because as you change the cell shape your basis set does not. Pylada does that automatically and this set the convergence between each relaxation step.

.. code-block:: python

    vasp.relaxation = "ionic"

This is where you set the type of relaxation (ISIF) the options are ``static``, ``volume``, ``cellshape`` and ``ionic``. If you wanted to relax the volume shape and atoms you would do.

.. code-block:: python

    vasp.relaxation = "volume ionic cellshape"

Most INCAR parameters can be set directly e.g. ``NSW`` is ``vasp.nsw``. If you are using a less common parameter sometimes you need to *manually* add it using this command :

.. code-block:: python

    vasp.add_keyword("NUPDOWN", 2)

Setting the input and output directories
****************************************

Lines 79-98 go through input files and add them to a list of structures. This is where I set the input and output directories and their naming conventions.

.. code-block:: python

    structures={}
    
    jobs = get_jobs()
    for poscar in iglob('POSCAR_*'): # <- This is where you set the input files     location                                                                          
    
        s=read.poscar(poscar)
        s.name=''
        name='output/'+poscar[poscar.rindex('_')+1:] # <- This is where you set the     output file location                                                          
        if name not in jobs: # Making sure it is not already running                                                                                              
            structures[name]=s

The rest of the lines just add the structures to the ``JobFolder()`` object which is the instance that will launch the jobs. This is where you could set ``INCAR`` parameters that are structure-dependent like the magnetic moment for example or ``NPAR``. 

Launching jobs
--------------

To launch all the jobs on Niagara you can simply uncomment that last line of ``HT_relax_example.ipy`` and run:

.. code-block::

    ipython HT_relax_example.ipy

But I like to do it manually in Ipython so I can make sure everything is ok

.. code-block::

    ipython
    In [1]: %run HT_relax_example.ipy
    In [2]: %launch scattered --account=rrg-ovoznyy --walltime=24:00:00 --ppn=40 --queue=compute

The launch command controls the account you are using the amount of time you are asking for and your queue. If you jobs have already finished Pylada will detect it and they wonâ€™t be relaunched.

Extracting Data
---------------

Pylada makes it easy to extract a lot of information on the jobs once they are finished. To get information in python or Ipython do:

.. code-block::

    python
    >>> from pylada.vasp import Extract, MassExtract
    >>> allresults = MassExtract("output_folder")
    >>> dir(allresults) # To get a list of available quantities
    >>> results = Extract("output_folder/specific_run")
    >>> dir(results)
